# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Using Python

I analyzed Instacart's data to uncover sales insights, suggesting strategies for enhanced customer segmentation based on specified criteria.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Objectives :  
conducted an initial data analysis for Instacart, aiming to unveil insights into sales patterns. My focus was on suggesting strategies for improved customer segmentation based on provided criteria.
## Key Questions  
● The sales team needs to know what the **busiest days of the week** and **hours of the
day** are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.  
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
**spend the most money**, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.  
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler **price range groupings** to help direct their efforts.  
● Are there certain types of **products** that are **more popular** than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which **departments** have the **highest frequency of
product orders**.   
● The **marketing and sales** teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:  
○ What’s the **distribution** among users in regards to their **brand loyalty** (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?  
○ Are there differences in **ordering habits** based on a **customer’s loyalty** status?  
○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a **customer’s region**?   
○ Is there a connection between **age** and **family status** in terms of ordering
habits?  
○ What different classifications does the **demographic** information suggest?
**Age**? **Income**? Certain types of goods? **Family status**?  
○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
